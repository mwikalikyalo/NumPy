# Learning NumPy

## Installation
** pip install numpy **

## Why NumPy is faster than Lists
1. No type checking when iterating through objects.
2. Faster to read less bytes of memory due to its fixed types. 
3. Uses contiguous memory (less memory look-ups as data is stored in a sequential manner)

## Similarity to lists
* Both can do insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation etc.
#### Note: NumPy can do a lot more like multiplying two different arrays.

## Applications of NumPy
* Machine learning
* Mathematics(MATLAB replacement)
* Plotting (Matplotlib)
* Backend (Pandas, Digital photography, Connect 4)
